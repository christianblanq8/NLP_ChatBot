# NLP_ChatBot

Purpose of this project is to gain an understanding of NLP and build a foundation for AI. I built this 
project to incoporate it with my resume website that I am currently building. I plan to take what I learned from this project and 
add it onto my website. This chatbot will be able to answer questions based on my resume and the details I added for 
the bot to learn more about me. 

I am using Ollama for this project and langchain. Once I gain more of an understanding of Ollama and Embeddings, I
will add on to a streamlit and hopefully publish it. I will give it a simple framework such as Streamlit.
